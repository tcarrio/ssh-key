[Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent](#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent)\r\n\r\nChecking for existing SSH keys\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.\r\n\r\n1. Open Git Bash.\r\n\r\n2. Enter `ls -al ~/.ssh` to see if existing SSH keys are present:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ls -al ~/.ssh\r\n  # Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n3. Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.\r\n\r\nBy default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:\r\n\r\n* id_dsa.pub\r\n* id_ecdsa.pub\r\n* id_ed25519.pub\r\n* id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\nIf you don't have an existing public and private key pair, or don't wish to use any that are available to connect to GitHub, then generate a new SSH key.\r\nIf you see an existing public and private key pair listed (for example id_rsa.pub and id_rsa) that you would like to use to connect to GitHub, you can add your SSH key to the ssh-agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you've checked for existing SSH keys, you can generate a new SSH key to use for authentication, then add it to the ssh-agent.\r\n\r\nGenerating a new SSH key\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Open Terminal.\r\n\r\n2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\r\n  # Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label\r\n  Generating public/private rsa key pair.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n3. When you're prompted to \"Enter a file in which to save the key,\" press Enter. This accepts the default file location.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n4. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see \"Working with SSH key passphrases\".\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\r\n  Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nAdding your SSH key to the ssh-agent\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # start the ssh-agent in the background\r\n  eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\r\n  Agent pid 59566\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n2. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you used an existing SSH key rather than generating a new SSH key, you'll need to replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your existing private key file.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  References: [Github: Generating an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)\r\n",
